# File_generation_proj
We need to figure out a way to update parameters which have been renamed under a certain managed object only.....for now its updating the values universally
#rules
#dont change the version strings
#2025 parameters supercede 2024
#the values from 2024 need to replace the default values of the 2025 datamodel
#if manage object has not gone to the next version then it doesnot need to be added as its depricated

#phase 1
#for implementation
#develop a map of the file
#perform crud operations

#phase 2
#if parameter names are changed...

#parse through the old version file if tag is found in the new one then tranfer the parmeter values
#for the second phse if the parameter names have been changed then edit the old versions parameter names then perform same operation 

#TO DO
#need to add initial 3 parts
